# BNN-PYNQ Brevitas experiments

This repo contains training scripts and pretrained models to recreate the LFC and CNV models
used in the [BNN-PYNQ](https://github.com/Xilinx/BNN-PYNQ) repo using [Brevitas](https://github.com/Xilinx/brevitas).
These pretrained models and training scripts are courtesy of
[Alessandro Pappalardo](https://github.com/volcacius) and [Ussama Zahid](https://github.com/ussamazahid96).

## Train

A few notes on training:
- An experiments folder at */path/to/experiments* must exist before launching the training.
- Set training to 1000 epochs for 1W1A networks, 500 otherwise with the `--epochs` flag.
- Enabling the JIT with the env flag BREVITAS_JIT=1 significantly speeds up training.

To start training a model from scratch, e.g. LFC_1W1A, run:
 ```bash
BREVITAS_JIT=1 brevitas_bnn_pynq_train --network LFC_1W1A --experiments /path/to/experiments
 ```

## Evaluate

To evaluate a pretrained model, e.g. LFC_1W1A, run:
 ```bash
BREVITAS_JIT=1 brevitas_bnn_pynq_train --evaluate --network LFC_1W1A --pretrained
 ```

To evaluate your own checkpoint, of e.g. LFC_1W1A, run:
 ```bash
BREVITAS_JIT=1 brevitas_bnn_pynq_train --evaluate --network LFC_1W1A --resume /path/to/checkpoint.tar
 ```
