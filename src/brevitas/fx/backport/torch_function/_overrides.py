Python implementation of __torch_function__

While most of the torch API and handling for __torch_function__ happens
at the C++ level, some of the torch API is written in Python so we need
python-level handling for __torch_function__ overrides as well. The main
developer-facing functionality in this file is the
torch_function_dispatch decorator. This function can be applied to
python functions in the torch.functional module to enable
__torch_function__ overrides for that function. See the examples in the
docstrings for torch_function_dispatch for details.

NOTE: heavily inspired by NumPy's ``__array_function__`` (see:
https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/24015 and
https://www.numpy.org/neps/nep-0018-array-function-protocol.html
)

def _get_overloaded_types_and_args(relevant_args):
    """Returns a list of arguments on which to call __torch_function__.

    Checks arguments in relevant_args for __torch_function__ implementations,
    storing references to the arguments and their types in overloaded_args and
    overloaded_types in order of calling precedence. Only distinct types are
    considered. If a type is a subclass of another type it will have higher
    precedence, otherwise the precedence order is the same as the order of
    arguments in relevant_args, that is, from left-to-right in the argument list.

    The precedence-determining algorithm implemented in this function is
    described in `NEP-0018`_.

    See torch::append_overloaded_arg for the equivalent function in the C++
    implementation.
