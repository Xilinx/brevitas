However, future implementations will move FakeTensorMode (and its owned ShapeEnv), as well

having to plumb complex subsystems across multiple verticals.

Ex: A common example is guard accumulation between dynamo, shape_env, aot_autograd, and inductor.

TracingContext.get() allows users to accumulate their own guards for processing, without needing to know how
